title: Multiple Kernel Learning on the Limit Order Book
abstract: Simple features constructed from order book data for the EURUSD currency
  pair were used to construct a set of kernels. These kernels were used both individually
  and simultaneously through the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) methods of SimpleMKL
  and the more novel LPBoostMKL to train multiclass Support Vector Machines to predict
  the direction of future price movements. The kernel methods outperformed a trend
  following benchmark both in their predictive ability and when used in a simple trading
  rule. Furthermore, the kernel weightings selected by the MKL techniques highlight
  which features of the EURUSD order book are the most informative for predictive
  tasks.
