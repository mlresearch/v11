title: Cross-associating unlabelled timbre distributions to create expressive musical
  mappings
abstract: In timbre remapping applications such as concatenative synthesis, an audio
  signal is used as a template, and a mapping process derives control data for some
  audio synthesis algorithm such that it produces a new audio signal approximating
  the perceived trajectory of the original sound. Timbre is a multidimensional attribute
  with interactions between dimensions, and the control and synthesised signals typically
  represent sounds with different timbral ranges, so it is non-trivial to design a
  search process which makes best use of the timbral variety available in the synthesiser.
  We first discuss our preliminary work applying standard machine-learning techniques
  for this purpose (PCA, self-organising maps), and the reasons they were not satisfactory.
  We then describe a novel regression-tree technique which learns associations between
  unlabelled multidimensional timbre distributions.
