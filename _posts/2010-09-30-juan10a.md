title: Handwritten Text Recognition for Ancient Documents
abstract: Huge amounts of legacy documents are being published by on-line digital
  libraries world wide. However, for these raw digital images to be really useful,
  they need to be transcribed into a textual electronic format that would allow unrestricted
  indexing, browsing and querying. In some cases, adequate transcriptions of the handwritten
  text images are already available. In this work three systems are presented to deal
  with this sort of documents. The first two address two different approaches for
  semi-automatic transcription of document images. The third system implements an
  alignment method to find mappings between word images of a handwritten document
  and their respective words in its given transcription.
