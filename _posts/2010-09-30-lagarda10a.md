title: Interactive Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology for Digital Audiovisual
  Content Processing
abstract: 'This paper describes ongoing research work by the Pattern Recognition and
  Human Language Technology (PRHLT) group (UPV PASCAL2 node) in two important technology
  transfer projects: i3media and erudito.com. On the one hand, i3media (2007-2010)
  is a 35M€ “tractor” technology project within the Spanish Programa CENIT-Ingenio
  2010, run through a consortium of 12 main enterprises of the media sector, which
  also involve 19 research groups, including PRHLT. i3media focuses on the creation
  and automated management of intelligent audiovisual content, so as to facilitate
  both, content personalisation and interaction with users (i3media.barcelonamedia.org).
  Our participation in i3media is centred on interactive machine translation, to transfer
  and adapt our experience on this technology to i3media-specific needs. On the other
  hand, erudito.com (2010-2012) is a 1.4M€ experimental design project, supported
  by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade under the Avanza I+D program,
  aimed at developing a tool to encapsulate, distribute and intelligently use digital
  content such as that showed on thematic TV channels. In this project, PRHLT contributes
  to the development of interactive closed captioning (speech transcription) and machine
  translation tools.'
