title: Visualization of Online Discussion Forums
abstract: 'This paper describes a set of visualization tools which aid the understanding
  of discussion topics and trends in online discussion forums. The tools integrate
  into the forum’s web page, allowing for easy exploration of its contents. Three
  visualizations are presented: a visual browsing suggestions mechanism, a semantic
  “atlas” providing a thematic overview of larger forum segments, and a timeline displaying
  temporal evolution of forum topics. The underlying algorithms have very few language-dependent
  components. The software is operational and can be tested live on Slovene, Slovak
  and Hungarian pilot sites, containing up to 5 million forum posts.'
