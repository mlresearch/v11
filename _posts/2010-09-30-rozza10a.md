title: O-IPCAC and its Application to EEG Classification
abstract: In this paper we describe an online/incremental linear binary classifier
  based on an interesting approach to estimate the Fisher subspace. The proposed method
  allows to deal with datasets having high cardinality, being dynamically supplied,
  and it efficiently copes with high dimensional data without employing any dimensionality
  reduction technique. Moreover, this approach obtains promising classification performance
  even when the cardinality of the training set is comparable to the data dimensionality.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by testing it on EEG data. This classification
  problem is particularly hard since the data are high dimensional, the cardinality
  of the data is lower than the space dimensionality, and the classes are strongly
  unbalanced. The promising results obtained in the MLSP competition, without employing
  any feature extraction/selection step, have demonstrated that our method is effective;
  this is further proved both by our tests and by the comparison with other well-known
  classifiers.
