title: 'HMMPayl: an application of HMM to the analysis of the HTTP Payload'
abstract: Zero-days attacks are one of the most dangerous threats against computer
  networks. These, by definition, are attacks never seen before. Thus, defense tools
  based on a database of rules (usually referred as “signatures”) that describe known
  attacks cannot do anything against them. Recently, defense tools based on machine
  learning algorithms have gained an increasing popularity as they offer the possibility
  to fight off also zero-days attacks. In this paper we propose HMMPayl, an anomaly
  based Intrusion Detection System for the protection of a web server and of the applications
  the server hosts. HMMPayl analyzes the network traffic toward the web server and
  it is based on Hidden Markov Models. With this paper we provide for several contributions.
  First, the algorithm implemented by HMMPayl allows to carefully model the payload
  increasing the classification accuracy with respect to previously proposed solutions.
  Second, we show that an approach based on multiple classifiers leads to an increased
  classification accuracy with respect to the case where a single classifier is used.
  Third, exploiting the redundancy within the information extracted from the payload
  we propose a solution to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm.
