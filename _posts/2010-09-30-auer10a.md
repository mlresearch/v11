title: 'Pinview: Implicit Feedback in Content-Based Image Retrieval'
abstract: This paper describes Pinview, a content-based image retrieval system that
  exploits implicit relevance feedback during a search session. Pinview contains several
  novel methods that infer the intent of the user. From relevance feedback, such as
  eye movements or clicks, and visual features of images Pinview learns a similarity
  metric between images which depends on the current interests of the user. It then
  retrieves images with a specialized reinforcement learning algorithm that balances
  the tradeoff between exploring new images and exploiting the already inferred interests
  of the user. In practise, we have integrated Pinview to the content-based image
  retrieval system PicSOM, in order to apply it to real-world image databases. Preliminary
  experiments show that eye movements provide a rich input modality from which it
  is possible to learn the interests of the user.
