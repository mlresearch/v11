title: 'Maximum Margin Learning with Incomplete Data: Learning Networks instead of
  Tables'
abstract: In this paper we address the problem of predicting when the available data
  is incomplete. We show that changing the generally accepted table-wise view of the
  sample items into a graph representable one allows us to solve these kind of problems
  in a very concise way by using the well known convex, one-class classification based,
  optimisation framework. The use of the one-class formulation in the learning phase
  and in the prediction as well makes the entire procedure highly consistent. The
  graph representation can express the complex interdependencies among the data sources.
  The underlying optimisation problem can be transformed into a on-line algorithm,
  e.g. a perceptron type one, and in this way it can deal with data sets of million
  items. This framework covers and encompasses supervised, semi-supervised and some
  unsupervised learning problems. Furthermore, the data sources can be chosen as not
  only simple binary variables or vectors but text documents, images or even graphs
  with complex internal structures.
