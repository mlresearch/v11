title: Facial Expression Detection using Filtered Local Binary Pattern Features with
  ECOC Classifiers and Platt Scaling
abstract: We outline a design for a FACS-based facial expression recognition system
  and describe in more detail the implementation of two of its main components. Firstly
  we look at how features that are useful from a pattern analysis point of view can
  be extracted from a raw input image. We show that good results can be obtained by
  using the method of local binary patterns (LPB) to generate a large number of candidate
  features and then selecting from them using fast correlation-based filtering (FCBF).
  Secondly we show how Platt scaling can be used to improve the performance of an
  error-correcting output code (ECOC) classifier.
