title: A Novel Hybrid Feature Selection Method Based on IFSFFS and SVM for the Diagnosis
  of Erythemato-Squamous Diseases
abstract: This paper developed a diagnosis model based on Support Vector Machines
  (SVM) with a novel hybrid feature selection method to diagnose erythemato-squamous
  diseases. Our hybrid feature selection method, named IFSFFS (Improved F-score and
  Sequential Forward Floating Search), combines the advantages of filters and wrappers
  to select the optimal feature subset from the original feature set. In our IFSFFS,
  we firstly generalized the original F-score to the improved F-score measuring the
  discrimination of more than two sets of real numbers. Then we proposed to combine
  Sequential Forward Floating Search (SFFS) and our improved F-score to accomplish
  the optimal feature subset selection. Where, our improved F-score is an evaluation
  criterion for filters, while SFFS and SVM compose an evaluation system of wrappers.
  The best parameters of kernel function of SVM are found out by grid search technique
  with ten-fold cross validation. Experiments have been conducted on five random training-test
  partitions of the erythemato-squamous diseases dataset from UCI machine learning
  database. The experimental results show that our SVM-based model with IFSFFS achieved
  the optimal classification accuracy with no more than 14 features as well.
