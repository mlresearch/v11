title: Detection of Server-side Web Attacks
abstract: Web servers and server-side applications constitute the key components of
  modern Internet services. We present a pattern recognition system to the detection
  of intrusion attempts that target such components. Our system is anomaly-based,
  i.e., we model the normal (legitimate) traffic and intrusion attempts are identified
  as anomalous traffic. In order to address the presence of attacks (noise) inside
  the training set we employ an ad-hoc outlier detection technique. This approach
  does not require supervision and allows us to accurately detect both known and unknown
  attacks against web services.
