title: 'MOA: Massive Online Analysis, a Framework for Stream Classification and Clustering'
abstract: Massive Online Analysis (MOA) is a software environment for implementing
  algorithms and running experiments for online learning from evolving data streams.
  MOA is designed to deal with the challenging problem of scaling up the implementation
  of state of the art algorithms to real world dataset sizes. It contains collection
  of offline and online for both classification and clustering as well as tools for
  evaluation. In particular, for classification it implements boosting, bagging, and
  Hoeffding Trees, all with and without Naive Bayes classifiers at the leaves. For
  clustering, it implements StreamKM++, CluStream, ClusTree, Den-Stream, D-Stream
  and CobWeb. Researchers benefit from MOA by getting insights into workings and problems
  of different approaches, practitioners can easily apply and compare several algorithms
  to real world data set and settings. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with
  WEKA, the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, and is released under the
  GNU GPL license.
