title: 'SubSift: a novel application of the vector space model to support the academic
  research process'
abstract: "SubSift matches submitted conference or journal papers to potential peer
  reviewers based on the similarity between the paperâ\x80\x99s abstract and the reviewerâ\x80\x99s
  publications as found in online bibliographic databases such as Google Scholar.
  Using concepts from information retrieval including a bag-of-words representation
  and cosine similarity, the SubSift tools were originally created to streamline the
  peer review process for the ACM SIGKDDâ\x80\x9909 data mining conference. This paper
  describes how these tools were subsequently developed and deployed in the form of
  web services designed to support not only peer review but also personalised data
  discovery and mashups. SubSift has already been used by several major data mining
  conferences and interesting applications in other fields are now emerging."
