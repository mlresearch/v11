title: 'Automating News Content Analysis: An Application to Gender Bias and Readability'
abstract: In this article we present an application of text-analysis technologies
  to support social science research, in particular the analysis of patterns in news
  content. We describe a system that gathers and annotates large volumes of textual
  data in order to extract patterns and trends. We have examined 3.5 million news
  articles and show that their topic is related to the gender bias and readability
  of their content. This study is intended to illustrate how pattern analysis technology
  can be deployed to automate tasks commonly performed by humans in the social sciences,
  in order to enable large scale studies that would otherwise be impossible.
