title: Modeling Knowledge Worker Activity
abstract: This paper describes an approach to constructing a probabilistic process
  model representing knowledge worker activity out of a log of primitive events, such
  as e-mails, web page visits and document accesses. Firstly, we present the process
  of enriching the primitive events into abstract actions, executed in different contexts.
  We explain the process of obtaining both context and action for each event by clustering
  the events via two different views. Secondly, we present an application of probabilistic
  deterministic finite automata to model the transitions between consecutive actions
  within the same context and demonstrate the approach on real-world knowledge worker
  data for the purpose of understanding knowledge processes and demonstrating the
  feasibility of the proposed approach, where a process model is constructed out of
  low-level events.
