title: Learning to Rank for Personalized News Article Retrieval
abstract: This paper aims to tackle the very interesting and important problem of
  user personalized ranking of search results. The focus is on news retrieval and
  the data from which the ranking model is learned was provided by a large online
  newspaper. The personalized news search ranking model which we have developed takes
  into account not only document content and metadata, but also data specific to the
  user such as age, gender, job, income, city, country etc. All the user specific
  data is provided by the user himself when registering to the news site.
