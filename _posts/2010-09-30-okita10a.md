title: 'Gap Between Theory and Practice: Noise Sensitive Word Alignment in Machine
  Translation'
abstract: 'Word alignment is to estimate a lexical translation probability \emphp(\emphe|\emphf),
  or to estimate the correspondence \emphg(\emphe,\emphf) where a function \emphg
  outputs either 0 or 1, between a source word \emphf and a target word \emphe for
  given bilingual sentences. In practice, this formulation does not consider the existence
  of ’noise’ (or outlier) which may cause problems depending on the corpus. \emphN-to-\emphm
  mapping objects, such as paraphrases, non-literal translations, and multi-word expressions,
  may appear as both noise and also as valid training data. From this perspective,
  this paper tries to answer the following two questions: 1) how to detect stable
  patterns where noise seems legitimate, and 2) how to reduce such noise, where applicable,
  by supplying extra information as prior knowledge to a word aligner.'
