title: 'Gap Between Theory and Practice: Noise Sensitive Word Alignment in Machine
  Translation'
abstract: 'Word alignment is to estimate a lexical translation probability \emph{p}(\emph{e}|\emph{f}),
  or to estimate the correspondence \emph{g}(\emph{e},\emph{f}) where a function \emph{g}
  outputs either 0 or 1, between a source word \emph{f} and a target word \emph{e}
  for given bilingual sentences. In practice, this formulation does not consider the
  existence of ''noise'' (or outlier) which may cause problems depending on the corpus.
  \emph{N}-to-\emph{m} mapping objects, such as paraphrases, non-literal translations,
  and multi-word expressions, may appear as both noise and also as valid training
  data. From this perspective, this paper tries to answer the following two questions:
  1) how to detect stable patterns where noise seems legitimate, and 2) how to reduce
  such noise, where applicable, by supplying extra information as prior knowledge
  to a word aligner.'
