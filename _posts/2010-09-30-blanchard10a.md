title: "$\\mu$TOSS - Multiple hypothesis testing in an open software system"
abstract: "Î¼TOSS is an R package providing an open source, easy-to-extend platform
  for multiple hypothesis testing (MHT), one of the most active research fields in
  statistics over the last 10-15 years. Its first motivation is to establish a common
  platform and standardization for MHT procedures at large. The Î¼TOSS software has
  been designed and written in the framework of a “Harvest Programme” call of the
  PASCAL2 European research network. Basically, it consists of the two R packages
  mutoss and mutossGUI. For researchers, it features a convenient unification of interfaces
  for MHT procedures (including standardized functions to access existing specific
  MHT R packages such as multtest and multcomp, as well as recent MHT procedures that
  are not available elsewhere) and helper functions facilitating the setup of benchmark
  simulations for comparison of competing methods. For end users, a graphical user
  interface and an online userâ\x80\x99s guide for finding appropriate methods for
  a given specification of the multiple testing problem is included. Ongoing maintenance
  and subsequent extensions will aim at establishing Î¼TOSS as a state of the art
  in statistical computing for MHT."
